    "Python is a dynamically typed language. This means that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime, not at compile time. Unlike statically typed languages like C/C++, where the type of a variable must be declared before use, Python allows variables to be assigned different types of values during execution without explicit type declarations. Depending on the situation, this can be a boon or a curse."
